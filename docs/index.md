## Can you survive the undead? ##

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, most of humanity has been infected by a virus, turning them into flesh-eating monsters. The players play a group of survivors attempting to make their way to safety. As society has collapsed and the infected outnumber the living, you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive this ordeal.


The game is directed by a ZM (Zombie Master) who sets up the scenes.  The ZM sets the story and creates the obstacles that players may face. This game is designed to be rules-light - loose interpretations may be necessary at some points and rules are open to interpretation. Players are encouraged to make their case on how things might go but the ZM ultimately makes the final call and decision in any part of the game.

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no natural immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

Will you survive or join the ever-growing Infected?

### Gameplay Overview ###



Each player controls a character and each character comes with various Stats, Attributes, Skills, Abilities, and Equipment. Players state their action on their turn and then roll dice to determine the outcome of the action. This game is based off of Dice Pools - characters roll X amount of dice for an action, depending on their character's expertise. Players can add an attribute modifier to the roll, based on inherent characteristics of the player such as Strength or Intelligence. Finally, the roll results are added up and compared to a challenge number to determine the success of their action.

Unlike other Dice Pool games, players have *limited* dice rolls based on a pool of Resources - Energy and Sanity and Ammo. Each dice roll will typically consume 1 of the resource (unless specified). Therefore players must carefully plan when to make rolls and how many to make. Players can restore their resources through consumption of food, alcohol, or other restoratives.

Players can improve their character by spending XP points to buy upgrades. These upgrades can increase your Resource Pool maximums, increase proficiencies, learn skills, increase attribute scores, or learn powerful Abilities. 

Other Notes:


- Each character has a Health pool. If this health pool is ever reduced to 0, the player dies.
- The standard dice roll is a D10.
- Combat is turn based. Players have 2 actions. Repeating an action twice in the same turn consumes 2 energy. Available actions are:
- - Attack
- - Move 5 spaces
- - Prepare to dodge - allows you to dodge one attack if you are attacked.
- - Interact with the environment
- - Reload
- - Change equipment
- At the end of player rounds, Infected will attack. If players do not dodge their attack, they will take damage and be grabbed. If they are grabbed, players can try to break free on their turn. If they remain grabbed by the next Infected round, they will be bit.
- Players can equip one melee and one ranged weapon.
- Players can wear one Head or one Body gear.



### V3.0 Change Notes ###

This is V3.0 of ZnZ. If you've played ZnZ2.0, here's a summary of the different changes.


- **Dice Pool System**
- - Rather than rolling a single D10, players now roll a number of dice based on a character's skill/proficiency with the action they are attempting. All the dice rolls are tallied up. Players can still add their attribute modifier to the outcome of each roll.
- - Skills/Proficiencies no longer give bonus, but now indicate the max amount of dice a player can roll for a given action. Players *do not* have to roll the max amount.
- - All proficiencies start at 1. Skills start at 0 - which means you can't make any roll unless you have training in the skill.
- - Attribute only rolls (such as strength or perception checks) determine their pool based on their Attribute Score / 2.

- **Resource System**
- - For active actions (not a passive check), players consume 1 resource (Energy, Sanity, or Ammo) per dice roll they choose to make. 
- - Players now have to consume water. 
- - Players still use consumables to restore Energy and Sanity. However, players **cannot** restore Energy, Sanity, or Health without consuming 1 unit of water.
- - Periodically throughout the day, the ZM can charge players energy/sanity based on what players are doing (i.e. walking for several miles consumes energy)
- - Players need to eat/drink something everyday or else suffer a negative side effect.

- **Rolls**
- - Critical Successes now add 1 free roll to the action's dice pool. This does not stack (non-exploding).
- - Critical Failures adds a negative roll to the dice pool, subtracting the final result of the roll.

- **Attacks and Armor Rating**
- - Attacks are now calculated through this method: the amount of dice rolled for the attack are added up. The sum of this is divided by a character's **Armor Rating**. The resulting quotient of that calculation is the amount of attacks that succeed. Each successful attack then rolls the weapon damage.
- - Armor rating determines how many successful attacks are made for a given sum of attack rolls.

- **Abilities**
- - Abilities now have level progression. Players can train an ability again to raise its level. As the level raises, it becomes more powerful and unlocks more effects.
