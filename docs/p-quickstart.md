## Quickstart Guide ##

Don't have time to read the whole guide or new to RPGs? Here's the general bullet points of the rules and how to play


### Basic Intro to RPGs ###

- You're a character in a post-apocalyptic Zombie World. ZM crafts the world and scenarios around you.
- You tell the ZM what you want to do and the ZM lets you know what happens. Anytime you do something in which the outcome is not set, you'll roll a dice. In this game, the dice is typically a 10 sided Dice (D10) where you can roll a 1 to a 10.
- Your player has Attributes such as Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc. By having higher points in this attribute, you can add a bonus to your roll when you roll for an action related to that attribute (i.e. Adding your strength bonus whenever you try to punch something. So you roll a 1D10 and add your bonus to the roll)
- There are also skills which do similar to the above attributes but are more specific to a certain action (i.e. Adding a Lockpicking bonus to your roll when you lockpick something)
- Combat is turn based and each player/enemy gets a turn. When you enter combat, you roll an *Initiative Roll* to determine your turn order. 
- Your player has several stats such as Health. This works like in Video Games - If your health drops to 0, you die. 



### ZnZ Specific Rules ###

- The standard roll is D10.
- Death is permanent. Getting bitten leads to death. 
- Attributes are listed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/p1b-attributes.html)
- Proficiencies are basically actions that anyone can do. You can add points to a proficiency and you'll get a bonus equal to those points when you do an action involving that proficiency. [List of Attributes]({{site.baseurl}}/p1d-proficiencies.html)
- Skills are similar to the above but you *need* to have at least one point in the skill in order to even attempt that Skill. [List of Skills]({{site.baseurl}}/p1c-skills.html)
- Players have Health (physical HP), Sanity (mental HP), and Energy (action points) that measures their current status.
- When doing non-combat rolls, players can spend their Health, Sanity, and Energy to add a flat bonus to rolls. 
- Players have Abilities that provide benefit or utility. They also have Flaws that can cause negative consequences.
- Players can re-do a roll by using a *Double Down*. The ZM will charge a significant amount of their stats to do so.
- Players can guarantee the success of any roll by using an *All In*. The ZM will charge them a very large amount of stats to do so. 
- Combat is turn-based. Players have two actions they can make on their turn which can be a combination of moving, attacking, dodging any enemy attacks or taking some other action.
- Each attack consumes resources such as Energy or Ammunition. Players can make multiple attacks on their turn by spending more resources. Each successful attack deals damage.
- Each round in combat costs Health, Sanity, and/or Energy so you must balance between making more attacks per turn to end combat quicker or make fewer, more measured attacks to maximize efficient use of resources.
- Infected always attack at the end of the round. 
- If attacked, you must have previously spent an action to *Prepare to Dodge* in order to avoid an attack. If dodging, roll a Dexterity Check (D10 + Dexterity Bonus) to avoid the attack.
- If you failed to avoid or didn't dodge, you get grabbed by the Infected. Your next action can only be to try and break free from the grab. If you end another round of combat still grabbed, you will get bit.
- If you are attacked from both sides, you get bit and die.
- Multiple zombies can attack you. You can only dodge one attack.
- You need to equip weapons to attack. You can have one melee and one ranged weapon.
