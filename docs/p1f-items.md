## Items ##

Players must use items in order to ensure their survival. Items can be either equippable or consumable. There are 5 different types of items

- **Misc**: Any consumable item or non-equippable item, such as food, alcohol, keys, etc.
- **Melee Weapon**
- **Ranged Weapon**
- **Head**: Any armor that can be worn on the head.
- **Body**: Any armor that can be worn on the body. 


### Inventory ###

Players store items in their inventory, where they can use buttons to add and modify items.

Each item has a weight and the inventory has a max weight. If the total weight of all items in the inventory exceeds the max weight of the inventory, the player becomes **encumbered**. A player can only have one action during combat and all rolls have a penalty until the player's total inventory weight drops under the max weight.

Players can improve the max weight of their inventory by finding bags and other equipment.


### Equippables ###

Weapons and armor can be equipped. In order for players to use the weapons and gain the benefits of any armor, they must first equip it. Equipping and unequipping is handled through the equip/unequip buttons on the character sheet. 


### Weapons ###

If an item is a weapon, it will have certain fields. Please refer to the (See [Weapon Fields]({{site.baseurl}}/p4a-weapon-fields.html) )for more information on what each field represents. It should be noted that any melee weapon can become a ranged weapon and any ranged weapon can become a melee weapon.


### Armor ###

Armor are items that are worn on the head and body. They convey some sort of beneficial effect such as damage reduction or stat boosts. They may also cause stat reductions as a result of equipping them (such as bulky armor reducing dexterity).

Armor can have **Damage Reduction** which reduces any combat damage that a player receives.
