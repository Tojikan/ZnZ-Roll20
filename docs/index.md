## Can you survive the undead? ##

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, you play as a human survivor in a post-apocalyptic modern setting where an unknown infection has spread around the world. The dead rise, the bitten become infected, and society has collapsed. Now you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive in this world.

Each player has a character with various Stats, Attributes, Skills, and Abilities. They must scavenge and utilize a variety of items and weapons to allow them to survive. They must carefully manage their resources, their own physical and mental health, and most importantly work together in order to survive. 

The game is governed by the ZM (Zombie Master) who designs the scenario and controls all enemies and NPCs. The ZM will create the challenges that the players must survive. This is not meant to be a exhaustive set of rules - the ZM may loosely interpret the game and players are encouraged to make their case if they believe an interpretation should go differently. Ultimately, the ZM makes the final call and decision in any outcome in the game. 

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

This is the undead apocalypse. Will you survive?

### Quickstart Guide ###

Don't have time to read it all? Here's the general bullet points of the rules

- Actions and outcomes are determined by dice rolls and the standard roll is D10.
- Players have typical attributes such as strength, intelligence, and dexterity that can be added to a roll that uses that attribute.
- Players have training in various skills and proficiencies that add bonuses when they do an action related to the training.
- Players have Health (physical HP), Sanity (mental HP), and Energy (action points) that measure their current status.
- When doing non-combat rolls, players can spend their Health, Sanity, and Energy to add a flat bonus to rolls.
- Players have Abilities they can use to help them. They also have Flaws that can cause negative consequences.
- Combat is turn-based. Players have two actions they can make on their turn which can be a combination of moving, attacking, dodging any enemy attacks or taking some other action.
- Each attack consumes resources. Players can make multiple attacks on their turn by spending more resources.
- Infected always attack at the end of the round. They will try to bite you causing you to wrestle to push them away. If you end another turn still grappled, you get bit.
- You need to equip weapons to attack. You can have one melee and one ranged weapon.
