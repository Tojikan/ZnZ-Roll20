## The Player Character ##

In this game, each player is represented by a player character. All information about this character is detailed in the ZnZ Character Sheet, a custom Roll20 character sheet attached to this game.

On the sheet, there are several sections that each detail an individual aspect of the character. These aspects determine how well your character does in different aspects of the game.



### Stats ###

Stats track the current physical and mental status, as well as growth of the character. This represents the character's current status and ability to complete actions, and are often used as resources for various actions and  throughout the game. 

- **Health** 

    The player's physical health. If a player takes physical damage, their health begins to decrease. If this is reduced to 0, the player is killed. 

    Health can be spent as a resource for actions or rolls that require


- **Sanity**

    The player's mental health. As the player endures mental trauma and stressful events, they begin to lose sanity. Mental trauma includes witnessing horrific scenes, disturbing events, high stress situations, or sudden scares. 

    Combat is an example of a high stress situation. Each round of combat adds stress which takes a toll on a player's sanity. Therefore, players should aim to end combat in as few rounds as possible.

    If a player is reduced to 0 sanity, they have accumulated enough stress that they develop a new trauma. When that happens, the player **must randomize a new unique Character Flaw (see below).** 
    
    In addition, if a player enters combat with 0 sanity, they may only make one of three actions, randomized by a D3 roll. 

    1. **Fight** - Fly into a frenzy where the player suicidally attacks the nearest enemy. The attack action and resources spent is determined by the ZM.
    2. **Flight** - Immediately flee from the enemy without regard to the surroundings or environment. 
    3. **Freeze** - Completely freeze up and not move or do any actions. 


- **Energy**

    The player's physical stamina. This is a measure of a player's ability to complete physical actions. Every melee attack roll requires energy to make. Strenuous activities such as running, jumping or climbing may cost energy to attempt and requires a  %}). 

    If a player runs out of energy, they become become **exhausted**. Exhausted characters:

    - Automatically fails on any physical action or melee attack.
    - Is not able to defend themselves with a defense action.
    - Is reduced to 1 action in a combat round. 
    - Take health damage.
