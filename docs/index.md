## Can you survive the undead? ##

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, you play as a human survivor in a post-apocalyptic modern setting where an unknown infection has turned most of humanity into flesh-eating monsters. As society has collapsed and the infected outnumber the living, you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive.


The game is directed a ZM (Zombie Master) who sets up the scenes. This is not an exhaustive set of rules - loose interpretations may be required and players are encouraged to make their case if they think things should go one way. At all points, the ZM makes the final call and decision in any part of the game. 


Each player controls a character and each character comes with various Stats, Attributes, Skills, Abilities, and Equipment. Each character has a pool of resources that they can use to improve the chance of a good outcome for their actions but must carefully manage those resources so they have it when they truly need it. Above all, players must work together in order to survive.

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

Will you survive or join the ever-growing Infected.

### Quickstart Guide ###

Don't have time to read it the whole guide? Here's the general bullet points of the rules

- Actions and outcomes are determined by dice rolls and the standard roll is D10.
- Players have typical attributes such as strength, intelligence, and dexterity that can be added to a roll that uses that attribute.
- Players have training in various skills and proficiencies that add bonuses when they do an action related to that skill.
- Players have Health (physical HP), Sanity (mental HP), and Energy (action points) that measure their current status.
- When doing non-combat rolls, players can spend their Health, Sanity, and Energy to add a flat bonus to rolls.
- Players have Abilities they can use to help them. They also have Flaws that can cause negative consequences.
- Combat is turn-based. Players have two actions they can make on their turn which can be a combination of moving, attacking, dodging any enemy attacks or taking some other action.
- Each attack consumes resources such as Energy or Ammunition. Players can make multiple attacks on their turn by spending more resources. Each successful attack deals damage.
- Each round in combat costs Health, Sanity, and/or Energy so you must balance between making more attacks per turn to end combat quicker or make fewer, more measured attacks to maximize efficient use of resources.
- Infected always attack at the end of the round. They will try to bite you causing you to wrestle to push them away. If you end another turn still grappled, you get bit.
- You need to equip weapons to attack. You can have one melee and one ranged weapon.
