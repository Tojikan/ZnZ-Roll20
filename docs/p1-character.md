## The Player Character ##

In this game, each player is represented by a player character. All information about this character is detailed in the ZnZ Character Sheet, a custom Roll20 character sheet built for this game.

On the sheet, there are several sections that each detail an individual aspect of the character. These aspects determine how well your character does in different aspects of the game.




### Interacting with your character ###

In the game, if running on Roll20, you character will be represented by a token. You can make adjustments to your health, sanity, and energy through the Roll20 radial buttons.

Information is managed on the sheet, but there are a few helpful macros that interact directly with your sheet to allow you to:

- Make a ranged or melee attack
- Reload your weapon
- Add an item to your inventory
