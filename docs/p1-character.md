## The Player Character ##

In this game, each player is represented by a player character. All information about this character is detailed in the ZnZ Character Sheet, a custom Roll20 character sheet built for this game.

On the sheet, there are several sections that each detail an individual aspect of the character. These aspects determine how well your character does in different aspects of the game.
