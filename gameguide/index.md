## Can you survive the undead? ##

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, you play as a human survivor in a post-apocalyptic modern setting where an unknown infection has spread around the world. The dead rise, the bitten become infected, and society has collapsed. Now you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive in this world.

Each player has a character with various Stats, Attributes, Skills, and Abilities. They must scavenge and utilize a variety of items and weapons to allow them to survive. They must carefully manage their resources, their own physical and mental health, and most importantly work together in order to survive. 

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

This is the undead apocalypse. Will you survive?
