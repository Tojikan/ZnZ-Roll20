## Creating a Character ##

Characters are created by allocating points to your various stats. To keep track of how many points have been allocated, there is a series of counters at the top of the character sheet to show you how many points have been assigned so far.


**Steps**

1. Set your name.
2. Allocate 21 attributes to any of the 7 attributes (Strength, Intelligence, etc.). The highest any attribute can go is 6.
3. Allocate 6 points to any of the proficiencies. None of the proficiences can be higher than 3.
4. Allocate 3 points to any skill.
5. Set your Max HP, Energy and Sanity. The total max of all 3 stats should add up to 120 by the end. 
6. Default Flashlight Distance is 10 which is your cellphone flashlight. Be warned - the battery does not last. 
7. Select 1 Ability
8. Randomize 1 Flaw.
9. Optional - gain another ability at the expense of randomizing another flaw.
10. Inventory - Set the initial maximum inventory weight and any initial items. 
11. Set your character token.
