## Fighting the Infected ##

Once all players have completed their actions and the round is finished, the Infected begin their actions.


#### Stay away ####

Infected will always move their movement speed. If there is a target within range at the end of their movement speed, they will try to bite them.

Your only defense is by spending an action on your turn to **Prepare to Dodge** (or not using one of your actions), which means your character is available to try an avoid an attack. Dodges are resolved if an infected attacks you at the end of the round. Your character can roll a dexterity check to avoid a single attack from a single Infected. If you successfully dodge, you avoid any damage or effect.

#### Don't get bitten ####

If your character gets bitten during combat, they will be infected and eventually die. If you are within the movement range of a Infected at the end of a round, they *will* try to bite you.

When the Infected attempt to bite your character and you fail to dodge, your character will fight back and try to push them away. This causes you to enter a **grapple** where the Infected is trying to bite your face off and you're trying to not let that happen.  You will take HP damage and Sanity damage when entering a grapple. If you are grappled by the start of your next turn, the only action you can take is to attempt the break the grapple as an action using a Strength check. If you beat the challenge, you will break the grab. If you fail to do so, you will remained grabbed. 

If you remain grabbed by an Infected by the end of the round, the Infected **will bite you.** Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to try and break grabs on yourself or your allies.

#### Don't Be Alone ####

Your dodge action can only avoid one attack from one Infected. Therefore, if multiple Infected attack you from a single direction, you can still get grabbed even if you avoid the first attack. If grabbed by multiple Infected, the challenge roll to break out of a grapple is **multipled** by the number of Infected attacking you, making it nearly impossible to break out. 

Sticking with your team is important, or else you may get overwhelmed by multiple attackers.

#### Don't Get Surrounded ####

If you are attacked on both sides (front and back), you are **surrounded**. There is no grab phase. You will be bitten, whether by the Infected in front of you or the Infected sneaking up behind you.

Avoid being surrounded at all costs.
