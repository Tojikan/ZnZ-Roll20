## General Rules ##

Smaller guidelines and rule of thumbs are listed here.


### Line of Sight ###

Characters must maintain line of sight to make a ranged attack. They must be able to see their target without obstructions.


### Movement ###

All players move 5 spaces by default. Each space represents around 5 feet. Weapon range refers to number of squares.


### Diagonals ###

Diagonal movement is not permitted (a diagonal move is 2 moves.)

However, you can make a melee attack from a diagonal direction.


### Lighting ###

Lighting is an highly recommended aspect of ZnZ. If you have dynamic lighting enabled, each character "generates" light up to their flashlight strength indicated in their character sheet.
