## Resting ##

Your character must rest in order to regain Stats like Health, Energy, and Sanity. A rest comes in 2 varieties.


### Short Rest ###

A short rest is a basic break, where a character can safely spend 30 minutes to rest. There must be no immediate enemies in the vicinity and the player must be in a generally safe location.

During a short rest, players can do the following

- Consume any food, medicine, or other consumables to restore stats.
- Socializing to restore Sanity. Once a day, players can roll a Humanity check to restore that much Sanity. In order to do so, the character must be in the company of other people.



### Long Rest ###

A long rest is a full night's rest, where a player can safely spend 8 hours to rest. Long rests must take place in a safe and fortified area or else has a risk of being interrupted. 

The long rest confers several benefits over a short rest.

- Any food, medicine, or consumable has a 1.5x effect (Restores 1.5x as much stats, rounded down).
- Players can spend XP to learn improve their characters.
- Players can roll 1d10 once to restore any of their 3 stats (Health, Sanity, Energy).
