# Can you survive the undead? #

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, most of humanity has been infected by a mysterious virus, turning them into flesh-eating monsters. The players play as a group of survivors attempting to survie this harsh new environment. As society has collapsed and the infected outnumber the living, you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive this ordeal.


The game is directed by a ZM (Zombie Master) who sets up the scenes.  The ZM sets the story and creates the obstacles that players may face. This game is designed to be rules-light with quick character creation. 

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no natural immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

Will you survive or join the ever-growing Infected?

## Gameplay Overview ##

This game is set in a post-apocalyptic modern setting, where hordes of flesh-eating monsters roam the world. In this world, most of human society has collapsed and survivors have been left to fend for themselves. Players must find a way to survive in this harsh world, by scavenging for supplies and weapons. Scarcity is a key focus in this game. Players must scrounge for food, water, and other necessities of life while fending for themselves.


- Each player controls a character that has various Attributes (inherent physical traits), Skills/Proficiencies (learned or trained knowledge), and Abilities (special powers and actions). During the game, players state their character's intended actions. Actions with indeterminate results will require players to roll a number of dice. The sum of the dice roll determines how successful your character is at completing the action.

- This game uses a *Dice Pool* system. Every action the character declares utilizes either a Skill/Proficiency or a Physical attribute. The character's level in this Skill or Attribute determines *the maximum number of* dice they are able to roll for this action. Note that this only determines the *max* number of dice they are able to roll. Players may want to choose to roll less dice because...

- All characters have a limited pool of *Resources* and each roll consumes a resource. Players have Health (Measure of damage taken and remaining life), Energy (Physical Stamina), and Sanity (Mental Stamina). Ranged and Melee weapons also have Ammo and Durability, respectively. Every Dice Roll for an action consumes one of these 5 resources. Players must carefully decide when to spend resources or when to conserve.

- If a Character has their health reduce to 0, they will die. If their Energy is reduced to 0, all physical actions fail, speed is reduced, and they begin losing HP. If their Sanity is reduced to 0, all mental actions fail, character actions are determined at random, and their character may gain a new Character Flaw.

- Characters can have Abilities which are special character traits or actions they can utilize. On the flip side, Characters also have flaws which are negative traits that make survival more difficult.

- The standard dice roll is a 10-sided dice (D10).

- Players gain experience points (EXP) by defeating enemies and completing tasks. EXP can be used to buy upgrades, such as learning new proficiencies/skills, increasing their resource pool maximums, improving their physical attributes, or learning powerful abilities.

- Combat is turn based. Players determine turn order by rolling initiative (with a D20) at the start of combat.
    - Players have up to 2 actions on their turn.
    - Common Infected will attack at the end of player rounds.
    - Players can use one of their actions to dodge an upcoming attack. 
    - Infected will usually try to bite players. If a player does not dodge or fail to dodge the bite attack, they enter in a *grappling* state with any infected. If grappled, Players can only try to break the grab on their next turn but *remaining* grabbed by the start of the next Infected round will cause them to be bit. There are additional rules against being grabbed by multiple Infected.

- Players can equip 1 melee and 1 ranged weapon. Players can also wear equipment on their Head, Body, Arms, and Legs.
