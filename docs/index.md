## Can you survive the undead? ##

ZnZ is a Virtual Tabletop RPG designed to be played on Roll20. In this game, most of humanity has been infected by a virus, turning them into flesh-eating monsters. The players play a group of survivors attempting to make their way to safety. As society has collapsed and the infected outnumber the living, you and your friends must use your wits and dice rolls to survive this ordeal.


The game is directed by a ZM (Zombie Master) who sets up the scenes.  The ZM sets the story and creates the obstacles that players may face. This game is designed to be rules-light - loose interpretations may be necessary at some points and rules are open to interpretation. 

**Death in this game is permanent.** If a player dies, their character is gone forever. Of course that doesn't mean they won't rise again...

**There is no natural immunity.** If your character gets bitten, they will eventually succumb to the infection and die. 

Will you survive or join the ever-growing Infected?

### Gameplay Overview ###

This game is set in a post-apocalyptic Zombie scenario. In this world, human society has collapsed and most survivors have been left to fend for themselves. Players must find a way to survive in this harsh world, by scavenging for supplies and weapons to survive. Scarcity is a key focus in this game. Players must scrounge for food, water, and other necessities of life while also fending for themselves.


- Each player controls a character that has various Attributes (inherent physical traits), Skills/Proficiencies (learned or trained knowledge), and Abilities (special powers and actions). During the game, players state their character's intended actions. Actions with indeterminate results will require a dice roll. The sum of the dice roll determines how successful your character is at completing the action.

- This game uses a *Dice Pool* system. Every action the character declares utilizes either a Skill/Proficiency or a Physical attribute. The character's level in this Skill or Attribute determines *how many* dice they are able to roll for this action. Note that this only determines the *max* number of dice they are able to roll. However, players may want to choose to roll less dice than that because...

- All characters have a limited pool of *Resources* and each roll consumes a resource. Players have Health, Energy (Physical Stamina), and Sanity (Mental Stamina). Their Ranged and Melee weapons have Ammo and Durability, respectively. Every Dice Roll for an action consumes one of these 5 resources. Players must carefully decide when to spend resources or when to conserve.

- If a Character has their health reduce to 0, they will die. If their Energy is reduced to 0, all physical actions fail, speed is reduced, and they begin losing HP. If their Sanity is reduced to 0, all mental actions fail, character actions are determined at random, and their character gains a new Character Flaw occasionally.

- The standard dice roll is a 10-sided dice (D10).

- Players gain experience points (EXP) by defeating enemies and completing tasks. EXP can be used to buy upgrades, such as learning new proficiencies/skills, increasing their resource pool maximums, improving their physical attributes, or learning powerful abilities.

- Combat is turn based. Players determine turn order by rolling initiative (with a D20) at the start of combat.
    - Players have up to 2 actions on their turn.
    - Common Infected will attack at the end of player rounds.
    - If attacked by Infected, players can use an action to dodge their attack. If they do not dodge or fail to dodge, they will be grabbed. Players can only try to break the grab on their next turn but *remaining* grabbed by the start of the next Infected round will cause them to be bit.

- Players can equip 1 melee and 1 ranged weapon. Players can also wear equipment on their Head, Body, Arms, and Legs.
