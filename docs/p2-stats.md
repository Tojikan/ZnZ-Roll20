## Stats ##

Stats measure the current physical, mental, and growth status of a character. Stats are often used as resources for various actions and [rolls]({{site.baseurl}}/p0-rolls.html) throughout the game. 
<br/><br/>

### Health ###

Measure of the player's physical health. If a player takes physical damage, their health begins to decrease. If this is reduced to 0, the player is killed. Extremely large drops in Health points may have negative side affects such as a bleeding wound or an injured leg. 

Health can be spent as a resource for actions or rolls that may put the player in danger. 
<br/><br/>

### Sanity ###

Measure of the player's mental health. As the player endures mental trauma, stressful events, or rounds of combat, they begin to lose sanity. Players can also spend Sanity to assist with rolls and actions that require mental capacity instead of physical capacity (such as hacking a computer or observing an environment).

If a player is reduced to 0 sanity, they have accumulated enough stress that they develop a new trauma. When that happens, the player **must randomize a new unique Character Flaw** 

If a player enters combat with 0 sanity, they may only make a **Stress Response Action**, randomized by a D3 roll. 

1. **Fight** - Fly into a frenzy where the player suicidally attacks the nearest enemy. The attack action and resources spent is determined by the ZM.
2. **Flight** - Immediately flee from the enemy without regard to the surroundings or environment. 
3. **Freeze** - Completely freeze up and not move or do any actions. 
<br/><br/>

### Energy ###

Measure of the the player's physical stamina. This determines the player's ability to complete physical actions and measures their general tiredness. Such actions include physical actions such as making a melee attack, running, jumping or climbing.

If a player runs out of energy, they become **exhausted**. Exhausted characters:

- Automatically fails on any physical action, melee attack, or defend action.
- Is reduced to 1 action in a combat round. 
- Takes double damage.
<br/><br/>

**EXP**

EXP is used to enable character growth. Players obtain EXP for completing tasks or successfully winning encounters. Players can then use EXP to purchase additional enhancements to their character.

- **Increase a Stat's Maximum Value by 5** - 10 EXP
- **Add a skill/proficiency point** - 20 EXP
- **Add an attribute point** - 40 EXP
- **Gain a new abaility** - 80 EXP
