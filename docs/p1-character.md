## The Player Character ##

In this game, each player is represented by a character. The ZnZ Character Sheet tracks all information and stats around this cahracter. 

On the sheet, there are several sections that each detail an individual aspect of the character. These aspects determine how well your character does in different aspects of the game.
<br/><br/>


### Interacting with your character ###

If running on Roll20, your character will be represented by a character token. You can make adjustments to your health, sanity, and energy through the Roll20 radial buttons.

Players can open the character sheet  in order to manage information or refer to their stats. 

In addition there are some useful features built-in to this game.
<br/><br/>

### Flashlight ###

If playing with Roll20 dynamic lighting, flashlights are an important aspect of the gameplay. Often you will find yourself wandering around dark environments or buildings without electricity. When that happens, the only way your character can see is through ambient lighting or through your equipped flashlight.

On environments with no lighting, your character token will emit a light which is determined by your flashlight strength. The ZM must enable dynamic lighting and set how much light you emit.

**Note** - if you can't see anything, try zooming out of the page first. If the whole screen is dark, notify the ZM.

### Macros ###

Macros are a Roll20 feature that allow you to quickly execute a command such as rolling a dice with the click of a button. For some of the more complicated actions, either you or the ZM can add Macros. See the [Scripts and Macros]({{site.baseurl}}/p7-scripts-macros.html) page for more details.
<br/><br/>


### Sheet Rolls ###

Players can make a roll in Roll20 by typing in "/roll" in the chat and entering in a dice notation (such as 1d10+2). This requires you to manually type in the roll and also add up any bonuses.

The ZnZ Character Sheet has built-in rolls on all Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies. Simply click on the skill or attribute you would like to roll and it should automatically roll your stat, add on any modifiers and equipment bonuses.
<br/><br/>


### Sheet Workers ###

There are a number of Character Sheet scripts that provide useful functionality when managing the sheet

- Calculating Modifiers and Bonuses for Attributes or Skills.
- Equipping/Unequipping a weapon.
- Counting up all points added to the sheet.
- Displaying the description of any Ability/Flaw.
<br/><br/>

### API Scripts ###

ZnZ comes built-in with some Roll20 API Scripts to automate common actions in the game. These scripts can automate:

- Reload your ranged weapon.
- Make an Attack Roll and calculate the damage.
- Add a new item to your inventory.
- and more!

Scripts are usually called by typing in a certain command but can also be used in a macro. 

See the [Scripts and Macros]({{site.baseurl}}/p7-scripts-macros.html) page for more details.
