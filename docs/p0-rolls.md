## The Gambit Roll System ##

As most Tabletop RPGs, ZnZ uses dice rolls to determine the outcome of actions. The Gambit Roll system allows you to improve the results of your roll by *spending resources*.
  <br/><br/>


### Basic Rolls ###

In this game, the primary dice roll is the **D10** (10-sided dice). When the player attempts an action, they roll their dice and then add any bonuses, modifiers, or penalties that affect the roll.

Example:

`Player tries to move a heavy crate. They roll a D10 and roll a 5. Because this action requires strength, the player can add their character's Strength attribute modifier (+1 as an example) as a bonus to the roll, which would make the final roll a 6.`

For every action that might fail, the ZM determines a **challenge level**, which is a number that the roll must beat or meet. To succeed with their action, the players must roll a number that **match or exceed** this challenge level.
  <br/><br/>



### Challenge Levels ###

There are 5 different tiers of challenge levels. 

- **Easy**: 1-3
- **Medium**: 4-6
- **Hard**: 7-9
- **Insane**: 10-12
- **Impossible**: 13+
<br/><br/>
  


### Spending Resources ###

**Resources** are certain character stats or items that a character can use to complete an action. For example, players must use Energy to attempt melee attacks or Ammunition to attempt ranged attacks. These resources can also be spent on player rolls. **Prior to rolling**, players can decide to spend resources to improve the results of the roll (at the discretion and direction of the ZM). If the ZM permits it, the players can then spend those resources to improve the results of their roll.

Examples:

`Player shoots with their gun. They spend 3 ammo to make 3 attacks.`
`Player is trying to kick down a door. They can spend an additional 3 energy (physical action points) to improve the results of their roll by 3.`

Adding resources can help ensure certain actions succeed and efficiently resolve conflicts. At the same time, if the roll fails, the player loses the resources they spent without achieving the desired result. Player should manage resources carefully and decide when to spend it and when to reserve it for more dire situations. If they completely run out of a resource, the character will suffer harsh consequences, possibly even the death of their character.

### Standard Rolls ###

A standard roll is used for any action that is not a direct attack against an enemy. These rolls all utilize a single D10 roll for the action and add any bonuses to the roll. Any additional resources spent gain a flat bonus to the roll result.

Example:

`Player spends 3 energy on jump action over a large gap. They roll a 5 with no bonuses or modifiers. The final result of the roll is 8`

There are no critical successes (natural 10) or critical failures (natural 1s). A higher result always result in a better outcome and a lower result always results in a worse outcome. Players can overcome natural 1s by spending enough resources.

### Resource Roll ####

A resource roll is used for any action that is more challenging than a normal action, such as climbing a wall or swimming across a river. Similar to a standard roll, a player can add modifiers and spend resources to improve the outcome of the roll. However, the result of a resource roll determines a resource cost to complete the action. Higher roll results mean that the final cost of the action is reduced (with each challenge level reached). After the final cost is determined, the player spends that amount and the action succeeds **If the player does not have the resources to complete the action, then it fails regardless of their initial roll**.

Players can still spend resources initially to enhance the results of the roll. Doing so may reduce the final cost of the action and may result in a more efficient outcome

Examples:
`Player climbs a tall wall. They roll a D10 with their dexterity modifier (+2) and reach a result of 7 which reaches a hard challenge level. The ZM determines that this will cost the player 6 energy. The player subtracts 6 energy and completes the action.`

`Player attempts to swim across a wide river. Player rolls a 5 + swimming proficiency (+1) for a total of 6. They add an additional +2 energy to the roll, resulting in a roll of 8. Each challenge level was worth 5 energy points and the player reached a hard level (7-9) from a medium level (4-6) by spending the additional energy. Thus the final cost is 10 points instead of 15. `

### Combat Rolls ###

Combat rolls are rolls that determine a successful attack against an enemy and work slightly differently to regular rolls. During an attack action, a player can specify however many attacks they would like to make. For each attack, the player can roll an attack roll but each roll consumes a resource (ammo or energy). Each successful attack results in a roll of the weapon's damage dice. In summary, combat rolls are designed to be *multi-attacks*. See the combat page for more details.


Example:

`Player spends 3 ammo on an attack action. This allows them to make 3 attack rolls costing 3 ammo. 2 of those attack rolls succeed, allowing the player to roll 2 damage rolls.`
<br/><br/>


### Double Down ###

If a player is not happy with the result of a non-attack roll but before the ZM declares the outcome of the roll, they can petition the ZM to *Double-Down* on their roll. A Double-Down allows a player to re-roll the same roll if they pay a sum of resources that is specified by the ZM. If the ZM agrees to allow the double-down, they will then state the cost of the Double-Down. If the player accepts and spends that cost, they may re-roll that roll **but must accept the results of the second roll**. Players **cannot** double-down again on the same action. 

The ZM can always refuse a double-down request at anytime. Any previously spent resources are not refunded.
<br/><br/>



### All-In ###

The **All-In** is a last resort action a player can make. Similar to a double-down, the player can petition the ZM to all-in on a roll. If the ZM accepts it, they will specify a cost that the player may choose to accept and pay. This cost is usually exorbitant and demanding **but by paying it, the action will succeed without needing to roll**.

The ZM can always refuse an All-In. Any previously spent resources are not refunded.
