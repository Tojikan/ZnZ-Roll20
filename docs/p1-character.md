## The Player Character ##

In this game, each player is represented by a character. The ZnZ Character Sheet tracks all information and stats around this cahracter. 

On the sheet, there are several sections that each detail an individual aspect of the character. These aspects determine how well your character does in different aspects of the game.
<br/><br/>


### Interacting with your character ###

If running on Roll20, your character will be represented by a character token. You can make adjustments to your health, sanity, and energy through the Roll20 radial buttons.

Players can open the character sheet  in order to manage information or refer to their stats. There are additional features built-in to the sheet to automate or simplify processes.
<br/><br/>

### Flashlight ###

If playing with Roll20 dynamic lighting, flashlights are an important aspect of the gameplay. Often you will find yourself wandering around dark environments or buildings without electricity. When that happens, the only way your character can see is through ambient lighting or through your equipped flashlight.

On environments with no lighting, your character token will emit a light which is determined by your flashlight strength. The ZM must enable dynamic lighting and set how much light you emit.

**Note** - if you can't see anything, try zooming out of the page first. If the whole screen is dark, notify the ZM.

### Rolls and Sheet Rolls ###

Players can make a roll in Roll20 by typing in "/roll" in the chat and entering in a dice notation (such as 1d10+2). This requires you to manually type in the roll and also add up any bonuses.

The ZnZ Character Sheet has built-in rolls on all Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies. Simply click on the skill or attribute you would like to roll and it should automatically roll your stat, add on any modifiers and bonuses.
<br/><br/>

### Inventory Management ###

Each character sheet comes with an inventory that player's can add items to. To add an item, click on the Add button. To delete or re-order an item, click on the Modify button.

Certain items will have equip buttons. These will equip the item to a designated slot on the character sheet. This allows you to use the item as a weapon or wear it.

<br /><br />

### Roll20 Radial Buttons ###

When you click your token in the Roll20 map, 3 radial buttons should appear. These allow you to manipulate your Health, Sanity, and Energy, respectively.

You can modify these Stats by typing numbers in the radial button.

Adding: +(number)
Subtracting: -(number)
Setting: (number)

<br /><br />


### Macros ###

Macros are a Roll20 feature that allow you to quickly execute a command such as rolling a dice with the click of a button. For some of the more complicated actions, either you or the ZM can add Macros. See the [Scripts and Macros]({{site.baseurl}}/p7-scripts-macros.html) page for more details.
<br/><br/>

### API Scripts ###

ZnZ comes built-in with some Roll20 API Scripts to automate common actions in the game. These scripts can automate:

- Reload your ranged weapon.
- Make an Attack Roll and calculate the damage.
- Add a new item to your inventory.
- and more!

Scripts are usually called by typing in a certain command and can also be used in a macro.
