# Adventuring #

The below is a set of generic rules and guidelines around non-combat gameplay.



## Resting ##

Your character must rest in order to regain resources like Health, Energy and Sanity. **In order to take a rest, your character must consume 1 unit of water**.

### Short Rest ###

A short rest is a basic break, where a character can safely spend 30 minutes to rest. There must be no immediate enemies in the vicinity and the player must be in a generally safe location.

During a short rest, players can do the following

- Consume any food, medicine, or other consumable to restore stats.
- Freely reload their weapons, change equipment, etc.


### Long Rest ###

A long rest is a full night's rest, where a player can safely spend 8 hours to rest. Long rests must take place in a safe and fortified area or else has a risk of being interrupted. 

The long rest confers several benefits over a short rest.

- Any food, medicine, or consumable has a 2x effect (Restores 2x as much stats).
- Players can spend EXP to improve their characters.

## Travelling and Maintenance ##

As your character moves around the apocalypse, the ZM may see it fit to charge resources. For example, going on a 8 hour trek to a destination may cost you some energy to do so. Additionally, the ZM may also check to make sure you are drinking water and eating food everyday, particularly in cases when the party is avoiding any actions that may require rolls. If your character forgoes drinking water or eating through an entire day or more, this will incur a penalty.

## Hygiene ##

Sanitary conditions in the apocalypse have notably deteriorated. To prevent your character from getting sick, you should aim to maintain proper hygiene by:

- Washing the body, clothes, and equipment
- Avoiding unsanitary positions as possible
- Boiling your water 
- Avoid contaminated or expired foods.

Characters have a Hygiene counter. As characters do actions that might threaten their hygiene, the counter begins ticking down. Once it gets low enough or drops to 0, the player may get sick, which results in negative status effects.

## Items ##

Players can utilize and equip items in the game in order to improve chances of survival. The item types are:

- Misc: Any consumable item or non-equippable item, such as food, alcohol, keys, etc.
- Melee Weapon
- Ranged Weapon
- Armor

### Equipping ###

Players can equip 1 melee and 1 ranged weapon at a time. They can also equip 1 special item (such as a grenade) for quick use. They can also equip armor on their Head, Body, Arms, and legs.

Armor can affect character attributes or proficiencies and improve their armor rating to reduce damage taken. See [Combat]({{site.baseurl}}/p5-combat.html) for more details on how armor is used.


### Inventory ###

Characters can store items they are not using in their Inventory, which is represented in game as a backpack. Each item has weight and the inventory stores a maximum amount of weight (It may be easier to picture weight as inventory slots).  Players can improve the max weight of their inventory by finding bags and other equipment.

If the player's inventory weight exceeds the inventory max weight, they will have reduced speed and suffer a penalty to all rolls until the inventory weight is reduced.



### Counters ###

The Inventory section of the character sheet contains an area for players to count objects of a broad category, such as "Metal" or "Glass". This is used when character pick up items for use later but do not want to individually track that as a new item in the inventory. Items in this section can generally be used as scrap for repairing or crafting new items. If a player elects to store items into the counter section, the ZM can tell them what categories the items will fall under and how many to increase the counter for. Once an item is stored there, it loses any specific features. All items in the counters section have a weight.


This section also contains counters for tracking Food, Water, Alcohol and Medicine.


### Consumables ###

Any non-specific food, water, alcohol and medicine without any special effects are stored in the abovementioned counter section.
