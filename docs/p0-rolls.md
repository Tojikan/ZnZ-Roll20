## The Gambit Roll System ##

As most Tabletop RPGs, ZnZ uses dice rolls to determine the outcome of actions. The main characteristic for this particular game is the idea of *gambling resources* to improve your roll results.
  <br/><br/>


### Rolls ###

In this game, the primary dice roll is the **D10** (10-sided dice). When the player attempts an action, they roll their dice and then add on any bonuses, modifiers, or penalties that affect the roll.

Example:

`Player tries to move a heavy crate. They roll a D10 and roll a 5. Because this action requires strength, the player can add their character's Strength attribute modifier (+1 as an example) as a bonus to the roll, which would make the final roll a 6.`

For every action that might fail, the ZM determines a challenge level, which is a number that the roll must beat. To succeed with their action, the players must roll a number that **match or exceed** this challenge level.
  <br/><br/>



### Challenge Levels ###

The challenge level has 5 different categories depending on what the challenge level is. 

- **Easy**: 1-3
- **Medium**: 4-6
- **Hard**: 7-9
- **Insane**: 10-12
- **Impossible**: 13+

### Resources ###

As mentioned before, the defining characteristic of this roll system is the idea of spending resources to improve the results of any roll. **Prior to rolling**, players can decide to spend additional resources to improve their roll. These resources all have the impact of improving the outcome of the roll.

Examples:

`Player shoots with their gun. They can spend additional ammo to make more attacks.`
`Player is hacking a computer. They can spend additional sanity (mental health points) to add a bonus to their roll.`
`Player is trying to kick down a door. They can spend additional energy or health points to add a bonus to their roll.`

Adding resources is a great way to ensure certain actions succeed. At the same time, if the roll fails, the player loses the resources they spent without achieving the desired result. At the same time, the player must be careful not to deplete all of their resources. Players might find themselves needing those resources at a more crucial time. If a resource is completely depleted, the players will suffer extreme negative consequences, all the way up to death.

Therefore, players must manage their resources carefully and decide when to spend it and when to reserve it. At what point is the risk worth the reward? Do they choose to engage in a course of action or do they avoid it based on the resources they have left? Can they find a way to resolve a conflict efficiently without spending resources? These are the many questions that may determine whether you survive or die.

### Non-Combat Rolls ###

A non-combat roll is any action that is not a direct attack against an enemy. These rolls all utilize a single roll for the action. Players can add their bonuses and modifiers to the roll. Any additional resources spent gain a flat bonus to the roll result.

Example:

`Player spends 3 energy on jump action over a large gap. They roll a 5 with no bonuses or modifiers. The final result of the roll is 8`

For non-combat rolls, there are no critical successes (natural 10) or critical failures (natural 1s). A higher result always result in a better outcome and a player can overcome a natural 1 by spending enough resources.

### Resource Roll ####

For any action that requires a resource just to attempt the roll, the player makes a *resource roll*. The player makes a regular non-combat roll as specified above with a D10 and their bonuses/modifiers/additional resources. However, unlike a traditional roll, the action will succeed but the result of the roll determines the resource cost of the action.

The resource cost depends on the challenge level that the roll manages to reach. If it reaches a higher roll, the final cost is reduced. Once the cost of the action is determined, the players subtract that resource. **If the player does not have the resources to complete the action, then it fails regardless of their initial roll**.

This type of roll is for feats are more difficult or strenous. It should be noted that players can still spend resources to enhance the inital results of the roll. This is again a gamble - they can spend resources initially to try and reduce the final cost of the action. Depending the difficulty of the action, this may pay off or it might not. 

Examples:
`Player climbs a tall wall. They roll a D10 with their dexterity modifier (+2) and reach a result of 7 which reaches a hard challenge level. The ZM determines that this will cost the player 6 energy. The player subtracts 6 energy and completes the action.`

`Player attempts to swim across a wide river. Player rolls a 5 + swimming proficiency (+1) for a total of 6. They add an additional +2 energy to the roll, resulting in a roll of 8. The additional energy manages to tip into the next challenge level and each level reduces the final cost by 5, resulting in the player to spend 10 energy instead of 15.`

### Combat Rolls ###

Combat rolls, or rolls for determining a successful attack against an opponent, work a bit differently. For a single attack action, the player can make multiple attack rolls against an opponent. For every attack roll that succeeds, the player may make a damage roll to determine damage. Every attack roll in an attack action costs resources. By spending resources, the player has more opportunity to deal damage in a single attack action.

Example:

`Player spends 3 ammo on an attack action. This allows them to make 3 attack rolls. 2 of those attack rolls succeed, allowing the player to roll 2 damage rolls.`

Refer to the combat section for more details on combat rolls.

### All-In ###

The All-In is a last resort action a player can make. If the player is not happy with the result of the action, they can choose to go All-In. If there is a way that makes sense for the action to succeed narratively, the ZM can allow your action to succeed but at an exorbitant cost to the player. Such costs are whatever the ZM fancies, such as expending most or all of a resource, losing XP, taking significant amounts of damage, or even death.

The ZM will let the player know these costs, and the player can choose to accept them or not. It is always up to the player to ask to go All-In. The ZM can always refuse an All-In if it doesnâ€™t make sense narratively.
