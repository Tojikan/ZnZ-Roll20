- canonical - A canonical name for the field that defines exactly what the field. It's not good to rely on a changeable attr_name or display_name in the template, so we can use canonicals to know exactly what the field is or is looking. This shouldn't change. Not all fields need this - just ones where the template has to know for certain what it is (like name or type)

- mod_attr - modifier field
- bonus_attr - bonus field
- check - 
- area - organizational.
