## General Rules ##

Smaller guidelines and rule of thumbs are listed here.


### Line of Sight ###

Characters must maintain line of sight to make a ranged attack. They must be able to see their target without obstructions.


### Movement ###

All players move 5 spaces by default. Each space represents around 5 feet. Weapon range refers to number of squares.


### No Diagonals ###

Diagonal movement is not permitted (a diagonal move is 2 moves.)

However, you can make a melee attack from a diagonal direction.

 
### Meets it, Beats it ###

If a roll meets a particular number, then it is said to beat that number.


### Rounded Down ###

If your roll ends up at a fraction, always round down to the nearest whole number.
