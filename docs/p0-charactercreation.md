# Character Creation #

This page contains steps on creating a character. If you want to understand more about the game system itself, read other pages first.


**Steps**

1. In the main stats tab, distribute points around your attributes (strength, dexterity, intelligence, etc.) as you like.
    - By default, your character starts with 3 in each attribute. This gives you a +0 modifier to all attributes.
    - This means you can have at most 24 attribute points distributed.
    - The character sheet should auto-calculate a modifier based on how many points you add to a attribute. The modifier is a bonus/penalty that is added to rolls.
2. Then distribute 5 points to your proficiencies.
    - Proficiencies already start at 1. 
    - You can spread these points around multiple proficiencies or add them all to one.
3. Then distribute 5 points to any skills.
    - Skills start at 0.
4. Set Health, Energy, and Sanity Maximums
    - These are located at the top of the sheet.
        - For every +1 Modifier in Constitution, add +5 points to your Health and Max Health. For every -1, subtract 5 points.
        - For every +1 Modifier in Athletics, add +5 points to your Energy and Max Energy. For every -1, subtract 5 points.
        - For every +1 Modifier in Tenacity, add +5 points to your Sanity and Max Sanity. For every -1, subtract 5 points.
5. Select 1 Ability in the Abilities Tab.
6. Then use the randomize button to randomize a flaw. 
7. **Optional** - Players can gain another new ability at the expense of randomizing another flaw.
8. Inventory - Set the initial maximum inventory weight and any initial items. 
9. Set your character token. 


**EXP Point Spending**

Players can enhance their character by spending EXP to improve their stats and learn abilities.

- **Increase Proficiency/Skill**: 10EXP to improve any proficiency or skill by 1.
- **Increase Resource Max**: 20EXP to increase Health, Sanity, or Energy Max value by 5.
- **Increase Attribute Score**: Increase any of your attributes by 1. 
    - Increasing your score up to 4: 40EXP
    - Increasing your score from 4 to 5: 80EXP
    - Increasing your score from 5 to 6: 120EXP
- **Learn an Ability**: 50EXP
- **Level up an Ability**: 
    - 100EXP to go to Level 2 
    - 150EXP to go to Level 3
