## The Gambit Roll System ##

As most Tabletop RPGs, ZnZ uses dice rolls to determine the outcome of actions. The Gambit Roll system allows you to improve the results of your roll by *spending resources* such as character Sanity, Energy, or Health.
  <br/><br/>


### Basic Rolls ###

In this game, the primary dice roll is the **D10** (10-sided dice). When the player attempts an action, they roll their dice and then add any bonuses, modifiers, or penalties that affect the roll.

Example:

`Player tries to move a heavy crate. They roll a D10 and roll a 5. Because this action requires strength, the player can add their character's Strength attribute modifier (+1) as a bonus to the roll, which would make the final roll a 6.`
<br/><br/>




### Challenge Levels ###

For every action that might fail, the ZM determines a **challenge level** which is a number. The player's roll must either **meet or beat** this number in order to succeed. 

Challenge levels are often described in tiers. The ZM will usually refer to the level by its tier. The tiers are: 

- **Easy**: 1-3
- **Medium**: 4-6
- **Hard**: 7-9
- **Insane**: 10-12
- **Impossible**: 13+
<br/><br/>
  


### Spending Resources ###

**Resources** are certain character stats or items that a character can use to complete an action. For example, players must use Energy to attempt melee attacks or Ammunition to attempt ranged attacks. 

These resources can also be spent in order to improve the result of a player roll. **Prior to rolling**, players can determine if they want to spend resources and how much they want to spend (at the discretion and direction of the ZM).

Examples:

`Player shoots with their gun. They spend 3 ammo to make 3 attacks.`
`Player is trying to kick down a door. They can spend an additional 3 energy (physical action points) to improve the results of their roll by 3.`

Adding resources can help ensure certain actions succeed. If the roll still fails, the player loses the resources they spent without achieving the desired result. Player should manage resources carefully and decide when to spend it and when to reserve it for more dire situations. If they completely run out of a resource, the character will suffer harsh consequences and possibly death.

### Standard Rolls ###

A standard roll is the common roll used for any action that is not a direct attack against an enemy. These rolls all utilize a single D10 roll for the action and any bonuses are added to the roll. Any additional resources spent will add a flat bonus to the roll result. Players can even overcome rolls of natural 1s by spending enough resources.

Example:

`Player spends 3 energy on a jump over a large gap. They roll a 5 with no bonuses or modifiers and add 3. The final result of the roll is 8.`
<br/><br/>

### Resource Roll ####

A resource roll is used for any action that is more challenging than a normal action, such as climbing a wall or swimming across a river. Simply attempting these actions will cost resources such as energy. The result of the roll is used to determine the final resource cost of the action. A higher roll means the final cost will be reduced. **If the player does not have the resources to complete the action, then it fails regardless of their initial roll**.

Players can still add on modifiers and bonuses, and spend resources initially to enhance the results of this roll. This may reduce the final resource cost of the action.


Examples:
`Player climbs a tall wall. They roll a 5 and add their dexterity modifier (+2) to get a 7. The ZM determines that this will cost the player 6 energy. The player subtracts 6 energy and completes the action.`

`Player attempts to swim across a wide river. Player rolls a 5 and adds their swimming proficiency (+1) for a total of 6. They add an additional +2 energy to the roll, resulting in a roll of 8. The ZM determines this is enough to reduce the final energy cost by 5, and thus the final cost is 10 points instead of 15. `  
<br/><br/>


  
  
### Combat Rolls ###

Combat rolls are rolls that determine a successful attack and damage against an enemy and work slightly differently to regular rolls. During an attack action, a player can specify however many attacks they would like to make. For each attack, the player can roll an attack roll but each roll consumes a resource (ammo or energy). 

If the roll is successful, the attack hits and the player may roll their weapon's damage, which is a dice roll specified in the Weapon Stats. The more attacks a player makes, the more potential damage they can deal but with higher resource costs. See the [Combat]({{site.baseurl}}/p4-combat.html) page for more details.


Example:

`Player spends 3 ammo on an attack action. This allows them to make 3 attack rolls costing 3 ammo. 2 of those attack rolls succeed, allowing the player to roll 2 damage rolls.`
<br/><br/>


### Double Down ###

If a player is not happy with the result of a non-combat roll but before the ZM declares the outcome of the roll, they can petition the ZM to *Double-Down* on their roll. A Double-Down allows a player to re-roll the same roll if they pay a sum of resources that is specified by the ZM. If the ZM agrees to allow the Double-Down, they will then state the cost. If the player accepts and spends that cost, they may re-roll that roll **but must accept the results of the second roll**. Players **cannot** double-down again on the same action. 

The ZM can always refuse a double-down request at anytime. Any previously spent resources are not refunded.
<br/><br/>



### All-In ###

The **All-In** is a last resort action a player can make. Similar to a double-down, the player can petition the ZM to all-in on a roll. If the ZM accepts it, they will specify a cost that the player may choose to accept and pay. This cost is usually exorbitant and demanding **but by paying it, the action will succeed without needing to roll**.

The ZM can always refuse an All-In. Any previously spent resources are not refunded.
