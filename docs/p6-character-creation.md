## Creating Characters ##

Characters are created by allocating points to your various stats. To keep track of how many points have been allocated, there is a series of counters at the top of the character sheet to show you how many points have been assigned so far.


**Steps**

1. Set your name and your token.
2. Allocate 21 attributes to any of the 7 attributes (Strength, Intelligence, etc.)
3. Allocate 6 points to any of the proficiencies. None of the proficiences can be higher than 3.
4. Allocate 3 points to any skill.
5. Select 1 Ability
6. Randomize 1 Flaw.
7. Optional - gain another ability and the expense of randomizing another flaw.
8. Inventory - the ZM will determine starting items based on your location and the current setting.
