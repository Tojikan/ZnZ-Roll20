## The Infected ##

An unknown, virulent disease has spread through the human population, turning them into lumbering monsters that seek one thing and one thing only - the flesh of the living. A single bite from the Infected is all they need to spread the disease and add one more body to the Horde. Below is a description of some of the common Infected you might encounter.
<br/><br/>

#### Walkers ####

When a corpse becomes infected, the body reanimates and becomes a lumbering shell of its former self. At this point, the rigor mortis has set in and the body becomes stiff and unyielding. Walkers are slow but are incredibly durable and tough. Only by dealing large amounts of damage to the vital organs and the brain, will the Walker finally fall down for the last time. 

Walkers are a slow but dangerous threat, doggedly marching forward until you are cornered with no escape. 

A walker appears bloated with discolored skin. Their body appears to be decayed and sometimes you may see human bone sticking out.

#### Runners ####

When a living human gets bitten, they do not immediately succumb to the virus. Slowly, but surely, the human begins to descend into a feverish insanity as they lose all sense of self while the virus attacks their brain. At the final moment, the virus finally takes over and the human is no more. Since runners are still technically living, they are capable of running and moving incredibly quick. They are less durable than runners and can be killed by dealing enough damage to their body. However, be sure to completely destroy them as a dead Runner may eventually become a Walker.

Runners are quick and dangerous. They can easily chase down a group of survivors and overwhelm them with speed. Be sure to take them out first.

Runners still appear mostly human as they are not dead and decaying yet. They tend to twitch and make nonsensical noise. As they no longer fear pain, it is common to see injuries and broken bones and limbs bent at unnatural angles.

#### The Horde ####

Just as humans are stronger together than individually, a Horde of Infected are extremely dangerous. Infected may group up and hunt for the living together. When encountering a Horde in combat, treat it as a single Infected with a very, large health bar. If a player gets attacked by a Horde, the player **must dodge the attack or they will be instantly killed**. There is no grappling with a giant pile of Infected.

#### Special Infected ####

There's been rumors of strange Infected wandering the Wastelands. What they do and where they come from are a mystery. Should you encounter one in the wild, you better hope that you're not alone and that they aren't faster than you...
